# Diffraction-pattern-for-a-surface-structure
Draw the non-reconstructed surface structure of a crystal. Consider the adsorption of an element, draw the reconstructed unit cell, check for symmetry conditions and draw the diffraction pattern in the reciprocal space. Evaluate the intensity of the GIXD in (h,k,l).
